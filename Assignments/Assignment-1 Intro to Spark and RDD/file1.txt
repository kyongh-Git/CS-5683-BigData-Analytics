{big data} a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that too large or #complex to be dealt with by $traditional$ data processing application software. 
data with many fields (columns) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.
[2] big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. 
{big data} was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.
[3] the analysis of big data presents challenges sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. 
there #fore big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value.
